The Android app for AutoArt.

On Android devices, make sure you are in non-mobile view (by tapping on desktop version) tap on AutoArt.apk, then tap on "Raw".  
Make sure to set width and height, then wait for an image to appear. Tap on it to download it.

The computer version of AutoArt can be found [here](http://github.com/pommicket/AutoArt).

If the images you download don't show up in your gallery, go to File Manager -> All Files -> Internal Storage -> DCIM -> Camera. The images should be a random string of numbers followed by .png
